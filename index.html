                        <h2>Teleperformance (June 2014 - May 2016) <br>Call Center Representative<br>WFM Real-Time Analyst<br>WFM Scheduling Analyst<br>WFM Reporting Analyst</h2>
                        <p>Originally I went to school be an Electrical Engineer. 
                            I applied to Teleperformance since I was in need of a job and needed <u><b>something</u></b>, <i>anything...</i> 
                            Teleperformance offered me the oppurtunity to make something of myself. 
                            Of course, I had to start out as a call center agent, but luckily enough for me, I was able to move into a more analytical job position within a month. 
                            This allowed me to avoid ever being on the phones (since I was simply in training up until that time).
                            From there, I advanced myself further by becoming an asset to the Workforce Management department I worked in at the time.
                            I would use any spare time I had to learn the scripting languager underlying Microsoft Office: VBA to increase efficiency and productivitiy within the department.
                            This in turn got me positive attention with my managers.
                            I worked at Teleperformance for two years, until I was unfortunately fired due to utilizing RegEdit to bypass their webfiltering.
