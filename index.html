                        <p>
                            Originally I went to school be an Electrical Engineer. 
                            I applied to Teleperformance since I was in need of a job and needed <u><b>something</u></b>, <i>anything...</i> 
                            Teleperformance offered me the oppurtunity to make something of myself. 
                            Of course, I had to start out as a call center agent, but luckily enough for me, I was able to move into a more analytical job position within a month. 
                            This allowed me to avoid ever being on the phones (since I was simply in training up until that time).
                            From there, I advanced myself further by becoming an asset to the Workforce Management department I worked in at the time.
                            I would use any spare time I had to learn the scripting language underlying Microsoft Office: VBA to increase efficiency and productivitiy within the department.
                            This in turn got me positive attention with my managers.
                            I worked at Teleperformance for two years, until I was unfortunately fired due to utilizing RegEdit to bypass their webfiltering.

                        <p>
                            I started work at Great HealthWorks as a Forecasting Analyst.
                            In this role, I was tasked with putting together a call volume forecast for the rest of current week and next week.
                            This forecast was based on historical media traffic from TV advertisements.
                            Additionally, I also had to specify how many people were required to answer those calls per 30-minute interval throughout the day.

                        <h2>Centerfield Media (October 2017 - August 2018)</h2>
                        <h1>Workforce Management Analyst</h1>
                        <p>
                            After gaining plenty of experience at Great HealthWorks, I was ready to move into a new role at Centerfield Media, learning new material and assisting with additional repoting initiatives.
                            In this new role, I was tasked with putting together the schedules for ~200-300 people across 4 locations.
                            Additionally, I also put together the forecasts that we based our needs on. These helped highlight where we needed people the most throughout the day.
                            As I got more familiar in myt role at Centerfield, I become well known for assisting with reporting needs, and anything to do with excel or tableu.

                        <h1>Sr. Workforce Management Analyst</h1>
                        <p>
                            With my recent success at Centerfield, and a less than desirable climate of layoffs at Centerfield, I decided it was time to move on from Centerfield and find something that was more secure for my future.
                            I started at ISG August 27th, 2018 and I have been loving it ever since. Granted, I haven't had much time to really have a strong opinion, but so my managers are really enjoying the changes I have been making to the department.
