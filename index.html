                        <p>
                            Originally I went to school be an Electrical Engineer. 
                            I applied to Teleperformance since I was in need of a job and needed <u><b>something</u></b>, <i>anything...</i> 
                            Teleperformance offered me the oppurtunity to make something of myself. 
                            Of course, I had to start out as a call center agent, but luckily enough for me, I was able to move into a more analytical job position within a month. 
                            This allowed me to avoid ever being on the phones (since I was simply in training up until that time).
                            From there, I advanced myself further by becoming an asset to the Workforce Management department I worked in at the time.
                            I would use any spare time I had to learn the scripting language underlying Microsoft Office: VBA to increase efficiency and productivitiy within the department.
                            This in turn got me positive attention with my managers.
                            I worked at Teleperformance for two years, until I was unfortunately fired due to utilizing RegEdit to bypass their webfiltering.

                        <h1>Workforce Management Forecasting Analyst</h1>
                        <p>
                            I started work at Great HealthWorks as a Forecasting Analyst.
                            In this role, I was tasked with putting together a call volume forecast for the rest of current week and next week.
                            This forecast was based on historical media traffic from TV advertisements.
                            Additionally, I also had to specify how many people were required to answer those calls per 30-minute interval throughout the day.
